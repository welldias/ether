What is Ether?

Ether is a tiny 3d library, a software package that allows you to 
create and interact with 3D worlds. It consists of a fast polygon-based
rendering engine and a set of support routines that make 3D world 
creation a reasonably straightforward process.

Ether is designed to be fast, portable and easy to use. 
It's written entirely in ANSI C. The API is simple and 
well-documented, which should make applications easy to develop.

Most important, Ether is GPL software.

Who developed Ether?

Ether was developed by Wellington (aka Well). It's designed to be somewhat 
backward-compatible with an earlier rendering engine called AVRIL that was
developed by Bernie Roehl.
